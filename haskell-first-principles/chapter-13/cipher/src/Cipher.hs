-- we take 2 strings one being our key and the other being our secret message. In the beggining our key is reduced down to a list of integers, because our string is 
-- being mapped into the function let2int wich takes a letter and returns an integer. we then cycle that function, esstionally meaning that our key wich is now a list of integers is being
-- cycled over itself repeatibly. i.e; [1,2,3] is [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3....to infinity and beyond]. with our recursively cycled list of integers we take that list and our message and take the elements of the key
-- and our message into the fucntion shift which takes a integer and a char and returns a char that has its position shifted based on the index of the english alphabet, i.e 26 chars.
-- our function continues to do this until all our elements in our list hahve been exhausted and thus we end up with list of ciphered gibberish.

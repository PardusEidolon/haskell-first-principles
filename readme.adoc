I'm shifting from a windows work enviroment to a Unix based one now. So as far as I'm aware windows is now legacy to me for the work I intent to be doing in the future. A sandbox for everything Haskell. I will be putting files here for the remainder of my journey as I continue to work through the Haskell first principle book.

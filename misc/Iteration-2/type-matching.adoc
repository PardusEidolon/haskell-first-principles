.Type Matching
****
Below you’ll find a list of several standard functions we’ve talked
about previously. Under that is a list of their type signatures. Match
the function to its type signature. Try to do it without peeking at the
type signatures (either in the text or in GHCi) and then check your
work. You may find it easier to start from the types and work out
what you think a function of that type would do.

.Functions & Types Signatures
1. a -> c
2. b -> d
3. c -> b
4. d -> a
5. e -> e

.Answers
1. ✔ Bool -> Bool
2. ✔ [a] -> Int
3. ✔ Foldable t => t [a] -> [a] -> _'Foldable' is just a list for this example_
4. ✔ [a] -> a
5. ✔ Ord a => a -> a -> Bool

.Some Anonymous Lambda functions
****
We’ll use anonymous lambda here to show some examples
of uncurrying.
